# ChinaAirQual

Python script that collects air quality data periodically for the top 50 most populated cities in China via https://aqicn.org/api/ and stores data in mongo for future charting.  Hopefully this can be a useful example for those wanting to query https://aqicn.org/api/.

Previously, used this data to drive investment decisions during the 2020 COVID shutdown.
